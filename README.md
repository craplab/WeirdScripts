WeirdScripts is a collection of all the programs which are programmed to behave weirdly. 

## Who is this repository for?

## How to Contribute 
1. Go to issues and ask to be assigned if you want to work on any of the exisiting issue, or feel free to go ahead with your own idea.

2. Fork this repository and clone that forked repository to your local machine.

3. Inside the `WeirdScripts` folder, choose your favorite language directory, create a folder with the name of your script (in small letters snake_case; eg: `awesome_script`) and add your own weird script that could surprise anyone.

4. Add a `readme` file in the folder that you created and give a brief description about the script.

5. Once you are happy with your code and readme, push the changes to the forked repository, and from there submit a Pull request to our repo.
