## Print numbers from 1 to 10 without using loops or goto statements

To iterate over the same block of code multiple times, there are a few methods which are as follows:
- Using loops
- Using goto statements
- Using recursive functions

Since we cannot use loops or goto statements, the only valid way is using *recursive functions*. Hence, here I have used the recursive calls to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
