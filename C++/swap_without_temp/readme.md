## SWAP TWO NUMBERS WITHOUT USING TEMPORARY VARIABLE 

The following program has been written in ```C++``` :

The program first adds the two numbers and stores it in the first variable

Then the numbers are subtracted and stored in the second variable 

Finally, the numbers (with the updated values) are subtracted and stored in the first variable hence successfully swapping it
